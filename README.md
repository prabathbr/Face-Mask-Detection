# Face-Mask-Detection

This project is developed to study popular deep learning networks in image classification and to use transfer learning in a practical application.  

## Objectives

1. Develop a neural network classifier to identify the eight classes defined by gender and different face mask worn type combinations.
1. Tune the Keras/Tensorflow based model to obtain 90 % test accuracy with a balanced dataset.
